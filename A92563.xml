            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by the Inſtructions of the firſt of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1643. the number of men foot and horſe are deſigned to come out of every Shire, for the encouragement and enabling whereof there is allowed two Dollars to every foot-man, and one hundreth pounds to every horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, well mounted with a good Horſe, and ſufficient Armes, and ſix ſhillings of tranſport-money for every twelve miles to the foot-man; There is likewiſe allowed one carriage horſe for every twelve foot-men, and one carriage man for every two horſes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing fifty Marks to be payed at the Rendezvous of the Shire for every one of the ſaid carriage horſes (they being worth fifty pounds) and the horſe to pertaine to the owner: As alſo there is to be allowed two Dollars for every carriage man, and a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pay.</p>
            <p>The Committee of Eſtates conſidering that by the ſaids In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions there is no way preſcribed when and how the ſaid
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151693:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 2 -->levie money and carriage horſe prices ſhall be payed, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought fit to declare the ſame to be in maner afterſpecified.</p>
            <p>In reſpect it was the offer of all the Shires, rather to advance their Loan and Taxt, then to borrow money, or ſend in band to the Committee; Therefore the Comittee appoints the whole Loan and Taxt to bee advanced by every ſeverall Shire and Burgh within the ſame, betwixt and the 15. day of November next, to the ſaid Subcollector within the ſaid Shire, for advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof there is two of the hundred to be rebated and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for annuall-rent to the advancers, and no retention to be allowed to any particular perſon, for any cauſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Every one ſhall advance his owne part, or otherwiſe one or more in every Pariſh to undertake and advance the proportion of that Pariſh, to whom is allowed the ſaid two of the hundred for annuall-rent, and two of the hundred for Collector fee.</p>
            <p>The money being thus advanced, the ſaid Subcollector is to pay to every foot-man, who being ſworne to their colours, ſhall march out of the Shire under command by order, the ſaid two dollars, extending to eight Marks Scottiſh money; and to every horſe-man well mounted and armed, as ſaid is, one hundred pounds money foreſaid: And to the owner of every carriage horſe (worth fifty pounds) fiftie Marks: And to every carriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man eight Marks of levie money: And to every foot-man, and carriage-man, ſixe ſhillings for every twelve miles, conforme to the particular note and exact count thereof, ſubſcribed by the Clerk of the ſaid collection, ſent to the Subcollector of every Shire, <hi>reſpectivè,</hi> the double whereof is herewith ſent.</p>
            <p>And becauſe by Act of Convention, theſe who have lent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, advanced victuall or other proviſion for Ireland, are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be payed by the ſaid Loan; The ſaid Committee findes this way of advancing the ſame to the Subcollectors to be moſt advantageous for the furtherance of the work in hand, and for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the ſaids perſons who have lent money, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for Ireland, as ſaid is.</p>
            <p>And that each Shire and Burgh within the ſame, may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the foreſaid ſumme of money allotted for the Levies, price of carriage horſes, and tranſport-money, ſhall not be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for any other uſe, then as is aforeſaid; The Generall Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, with advice and command of the ſaid Committee of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, gives warrand and power to the Sub-collectors within ilk Shire, after receipt of the money ſo to be advanced, to give band and ſecuritie, to keep the ſaid proportion of money in his own hand, and not to diſpoſe thereupon, untill further order come for marching or muſtering of the ſaid men, Foot and Horſe, with carriage horſes, and men conforme: At which time, he ſhall deliver the ſame in manner above-written as the Colonels
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151693:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 2 -->and Committees of Warre ſhall appoint for the uſes aforeſaid, the remanent alwayes of the whole ſumme being advanced, as ſaid is: To the effect theſe who have lent money, and advanced victuall and proviſion for Ireland, may be ſatisfied, conforme to the renour of the ſaid Act of Convention.</p>
            <p>And ſiclike the ſaid Committees of Warre within the whole Kingdome are entreated to have their Regiments and Troupes of Foot and Horſe, aſwell theſe who are to come out upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, as theſe who ſtayes within, (where the ſame is not alreadie done) formed, enrolled, put under command, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and made in readineſſe, That upon fourtie eight houres war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, their numbers appointed may be ready to march, with their carriage horſes, armes, and all other proviſion contained in the former inſtructions of the firſt of September laſt.</p>
            <p>And the Colonels and Committees in every Shire are to take ſpeciall care, as they would make conſcience of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and regard the cauſe in hand, that the ſaid Loane and Taxt be advanced: And that the Souldiers appointed to come forth, be of the ableſt and moſt vigorous men in each Pariſh: And that they doe not upon any termes admit old nor weak men, nor young boyes and naughtie bodies to come forth. And if any ſuch perſon ſhall be offered to them, that they refuſe him, and unleſſe the Heritor furniſh an able man in his place, it ſhall be lawfull to the Committee and Colonel, to take the ableſt man or ſervant that belongeth to the ſaid Heritor. And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees are to cauſe the Heritors provide them Souldiers with Arms, two part Muskets, and third part Pikes. And that the Colonels cauſe their Captains to be buſie in training and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Souldiers to handle their Arms: And alſo to be carefull that as many be made choice of, of theſe who ſerved in the laſt expedition, both Officers &amp; Souldiers, as can be conveniently had.</p>
            <p>And becauſe every Regiment muſt carry their own Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and draw their own fielding-pieces, and other materialls; the Committee ordains that ilk Shire and Diviſion ſhall either buy 12. horſes for every Regiment, upon the expences of the Shire or Diviſion, or hire them to be payed by the publick after they come to the Generall Rendezvous, as other carriage horſes of the Artillerie, <hi>viz.</hi> allowing a man for every two horſe, who is to have pay as a common Souldier, and for each horſe twelve ſhillings. Every horſe-man is to have eighteen ſhillings ſcots in their tranſport, for every twenty miles from their Rendezvous in the Shire, to the Generall Rendezvous.</p>
            <p>And it is ordained that report be made hereof by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of Warre in ilk Shire (to whom the ſame is recommended) aſwell anent the advance of the Loane and Taxt, as anent the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars foreſaids, with all convenient diligence, after the receipt hereof.</p>
